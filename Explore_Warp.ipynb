    "The ants software, can perform registration of a moving image versus a fixed or reference image. When the transformation is non-linear, ants output a *warp* file and an *inverse-warp* file.\n",
    "# The warp file\n",
    "* It is a vectorial field that encode voxel per voxel the trasformation to register the image from moving-space to fixed space. It assumes they are already in the same space; for example thanks to an affine registration, previoulsy performed. \n",
    "\n",
    "* It is defined in reference, or fixed image space . This means there is a direct correspondance between the dimensions of the warp and the one of the fixed image. It has three channels. So there are three values for each coordinate of the fixed space.\n",
    "Eg: If a fixed image has dimension nxmxh the Warp image dimension is nxmxhx3\n",
    "\n",
    "* The Warp image information is encoded in two entities:\n",
    "   * **the coordinates of the warp-image voxel**. These should be interpreted as a \"destination point\" of the trasformation from the moving space to the fixed space. Now you should wonder: \"these are the destination point, but where are encoded the point I have to move versus the destination points?\" The answer will come very soon.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   * the **voxels values** or **vectors**. Each coordinate of the warp-image, corresponding to a coordinate in the fixed space, has three voxels associated. These three values are 3-D vectors that point somewhere in the moving space. They encode the displacement in mm of the moving point I want to move, with respect to the position of the coordinate where they are stored. So this is the answer to the previous question: when ants compute the registration these vectors indicate which points in moving space will be moved in fixed space, versus the coordinate where they are stored [1,2]. \n",
    "\n",
    "# The inverse warp file\n",
    "* The inverse warp file is defined similarly to the warp. The difference is that it is a vectorial field encoding the \"iverse\" trasformation from fixed-space to moving space, voxel per voxel. It also assume the moving and fixed space were already normalized with a linear registration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is defined in moving space. So the dimension of the nifti image are the one of the moving image. Similarly to the warp file has three channels, or values for each coordinate of the moving space.\n",

    "* As for the Warp image the information is encoded in the two entities:\n",
    "   * **the coordinates of the inverse-warp-image voxel**. These should again be interpreted as a \"destination point\" of the trasformation, that is now from reference or fixed space to moving space. \n",
    "   \n",
    "   * the **voxels values** or **vectors**. Each coordinate of the inverse-warp-image, corresponding to a coordinate in the fixed space, has as before 3 voxels associated, that are 3-D vectors. These vectors point somewhere in the fixed space. As before they encode the displacement in mm of the point in the fixed space, with respect to the position of the coordinate where they are stored.
